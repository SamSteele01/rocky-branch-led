# Rocky Branch LED

Six lighting fixtures in the south Saunders pedestrian tunnel in Raleigh, NC.

Each lighting fixture has one infinity mirror, which has 576 LEDs or a few less; and two runs for edge-lit clear acrylic, which has multiple pieces of varying length per run. The runs are on one side of the infinity mirror or another.
